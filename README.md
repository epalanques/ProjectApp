# SwipeCardsApp

This App is being created following the SimCoder tutorials and then being modified!

The purpose of this app is firstly for me to learn how to code in Android Studio and use GitHub.
Secondly to create a useful app that hopefuly I will update to Google Play.

It has a tinder-like interface that I find very useful for quickly classifying things. 
The final function is yet to be defined since I initally created it to rapidly find a place to eat but I later found out that this idea was already developed by the Food Guide app.
